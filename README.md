## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Muzaffar**, a software developer focused on **C++** and backend development.

I like building real things — tools, services, systems — not just tutorials.  
If an idea feels useful, I try to implement it and push it to production.

My main interests are:
- modern **C++**
- system & low-level programming
- backend architecture
- performance and clean code

Most of my projects come from real needs or freelance work, not demo apps.
